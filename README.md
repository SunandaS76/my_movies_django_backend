1) Create a virtual environment for python - https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
2) Run the following command in the environment to install all packages: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
3) Run the project-server by running the following command: python3 manage.py runserver

(please have pip3 and python3 installed on your PC as Ubuntu generally has python2.7 installed :)
